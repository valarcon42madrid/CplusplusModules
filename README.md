          THOSE FILES REPRESENTS THE PROYECTS RELATED WITH C++:

I'm going to make a brief resume to try all of them, remember to use "make" to compile it before:
-
- .

    * C++00:


- ex00: "./megaphone Text" = TEXT
- ex01: "./PhoneBook" + "ADD" + fields info. Then use "SEARCH" + Index nº. to watch it.


    * C++01:


- ex00: "./zombie" executes a creation, call, soft copy and destruction of a class.
- ex01: "./zombie" repeats the proccess of the ex00 8 times and using a pointer to the first one.
- ex02: "./HiThisIsBrain" executes a code to demonstrate the relation of identic parameters between a string, it´s pointer and it's reference.
- ex03: "./UnnecessaryViolence" creates two clases, gives one to the other and then modify the gifted class, showing the change from the other class.
- ex04: "./Replace AnyFile CharacterToSearch CharacterToReplace" creates a new AnyFile.replace with the deductable differences.
- ex05: "./harl" + "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING" or "ERROR" make's a call for the apropiate private member function.


     * C++02:

  
- ex00: "./MyFirstOrtodoxClass" make some classes in Orthodox Canonical Form and calls their public members.
- ex01: "./MoreUsefulFixedPointClass" repeat the creation of classes in Orthodox Canonical Form and calls their public members, showing their pure values and their values as integer.
- ex02: "./NowWeReTalking" make the same as the two previous exercises but now opperating with those values.


     * C++03:


- ex00: "./Aaaaand...OPEN\!" executes a code making classes and calling their public members, which access to the private attributes to emulate a simple game's encapsulation.
- ex01: "./Serena,_my_love\!" repeats the usage of classes adding a new one wich inherit the constructors and destructor from the last one.
- ex02: "./Repetitive_work" makes again the inheritance of the first class but modifiying it.
- ex03: "./Now_its_weird\!" makes a inheritance from two classes (the original and the modified one) and is able to use members from both of them, but it only has it's own class.


    * C++04:

 
- ex00: "./Polymorphism" make two different classes that inherits from another one.
- ex01: "./I_dont_want_to_set_the_world_on_fire" adds the implementation of the brain class to each class (dog and cat) inhereting from the Animal class. The brain copies are deeps.
- ex02: "./Abstact_class" repeats the proccess but using an abstract Animal class that avoid to create just an "Animal" with no type.
- ex03: "./Interface_recap" executes a test using classes, inheritances, calls and (deep) clones.


    * C++05:

 - ex00: "./bureaucrat" Executes a test for the class that simulates a low-level worker with Name & Grade (1-150), Validations of grade range with exceptions, Provides getters & methods (increment/decrement grade) and Overloads << for printing info.
 - ex01: "./maggots" Test the management of bureaucratic forms with: Name, signed status, required signing/execution grades (1-150), Enforces valid grade range with exceptions, Provides getters and overloaded insertion (<<) for printing, beSigned checks bureaucrat grade for permission to sign and Bureaucrat signForm attemptings to sign the form, handling success/failure.
 - ex02: "./you_need_form..." test implementation of an abstract base class AForm for bureaucratic forms with: Private attributes, Enforced valid grade range with exceptions, Concrete derived classes and Member functions.
 - ex03: "./coffee_making" test for Management of bureaucratic interns with: makeForm function creation forms by name and target, Supporting for various form types and Handling invalid form requests with error messages.


   * C++06:
  
- ex00:
