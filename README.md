          THOSE FILES REPRESENTS THE PROYECTS RELATED WITH C++:

I'm going to make a brief resume to try all of them, remember to use "make" to compile it before:
-


 * C++00:
     
- ex00: "./megaphone Text" = TEXT
- ex01: "./PhoneBook" + "ADD" + fields info. Then use "SEARCH" + Index nº. to watch it.

  * C++01:

 - ex00: "./zombie" executes a creation, call, soft copy and destruction of a class.
 - ex01: "./zombie" repeats the proccess of the ex00 8 times and using a pointer to the first one.
 - ex02: "./HiThisIsBrain" executes a code to demonstrate the relation of identic parameters between a string, it´s pointer and it's reference.
 - ex03: "./UnnecessaryViolence" creates two clases, gives one to the other and then modify the gifted class, showing the change from the other class.
 - ex04: "./Replace AnyFile CharacterToSearch CharacterToReplace" creates a new AnyFile.replace with the deductable differences.
 - ex05: "./harl" + "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING" or "ERROR" make's a call for the apropiate private member function.

   * C++02:
  
- ex00: "./MyFirstOrtodoxClass" make some classes in Orthodox Canonical Form and calls their public members.
- ex01: "./MoreUsefulFixedPointClass" repeat the creation of classes in Orthodox Canonical Form and calls their public members, showing their pure values and their values as integer.
- ex02: "./NowWeReTalking" make the same as the two previous exercises but now opperating with those values.

   * C++03:

- ex00: "./Aaaaand...OPEN\!" executes a code making classes and calling their public members, which access to the private attributes to emulate a simple game's encapsulation.
- ex01: "./Serena,_my_love\!" repeats the usage of classes adding a new one wich inherit the constructors and destructor from the last one.
- ex02: "./Repetitive_work" makes again the inheritance of the first class but modifiying it.
- ex03: "./Now_its_weird\!" makes a inheritance from two classes (the original and the modified one) and is able to use members from both of them, but it only has it's own class.

  * C++04:
 
- ex00: "./Polymorphism" make two different classes that inherits from another one.
- ex01: "./I_dont_want_to_set_the_world_on_fire" adds the implementation of the brain class to each class (dog and cat) inhereting from the Animal class. The brain copies are deeps.
- ex02: "./Abstact_class" repeats the proccess but using an abstract Animal class that avoid to create just an "Animal" with no type.
- ex03: "./Interface_recap" executes a test using classes, inheritances, calls and (deep) clones.

  * C++05:
