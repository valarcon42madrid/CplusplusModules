* ex00: "./Aaaaand...OPEN!" executes a code making classes and calling their public members, which access to the private attributes to emulate a simple game's encapsulation. 

* ex01: "./Serena,_my_love!" repeats the usage of classes adding a new one wich inherit the constructors and destructor from the last one. 

* ex02: "./Repetitive_work" makes again the inheritance of the first class but modifiying it. 

* ex03: "./Now_its_weird!" makes a inheritance from two classes (the original and the modified one) and is able to use members from both of them, but it only has it's own class.
